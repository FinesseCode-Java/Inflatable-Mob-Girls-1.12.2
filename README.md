Currently mod adds 3 types of mob girls.

Creeper gal:

    spawns in the overworld, in plains biome
    the more damage she takes, the bigger her belly grows. at low health, she violently explodes
    after she explodes, her legs are left on the ground, be careful because at this state she can die by one hit.
    she can be healed via bone meal.
    if lighting strikes her, she turns into the more powerful - charged creeper.
    after exploding she drops creeper spores which can be planted and grown into mini creepers 

Creeper girl minion:

    can be grown like a crop. she gets automatically tamed by the player when fully grown
    smaller and weaker than the creeper girl
    unlike their bigger counterparts, these can not regenerate after exploding
    healed via bone meal

Ghast girl:

    found in nether wastes
    tamed via soul chocolate
    can be ridden by player
